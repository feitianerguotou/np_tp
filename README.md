The microenvironment and cell populations in the myometrium are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the uterus and protecting the fetus during pregnancy. However, a cell atlas of the human myometrium during pregnancy is lacking so far. We employed single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) to construct a transcriptomic atlas of individual cells in the myometrium from non-pregnant (NP) and term pregnant (TP) women. From the scRNA-seq data of 10 human myometrium tissues, 76,051 high-quality individual cells were identified and were categorized into twelve cell populations. We revealed dynamic gene expression in diverse cell populations during pregnancy. Integrated analysis of the scRNA-seq and ST data was performed to reveal transcriptional characteristics in the spatial domain. Our results indicated that the proportion of four sub-populations of smooth muscle cells were altered in TP. In addition, we found increased monocytic cells in TP myometrium samples, especially M2 macrophages, suggesting that this was a required factor for the anti-inflammatory response. Taken together, our results provide an unprecedented single-cell resolution of the myometrium in NP and TP women, which offers new insights into myometrial remodeling during pregnancy.
